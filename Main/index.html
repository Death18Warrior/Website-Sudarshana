                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The tragic incidents of the Nirbhaya case and the Kolkata rape case, where women were subjected to brutal violence, served as a powerful catalyst for us to create a solution aimed at preventing such atrocities.In most cases, the victims suffered immense trauma, and the lack of timely intervention highlighted the vulnerability women face in public spaces. These events deeply affected us and inspired the development of Sudarshana, a wearable safety device designed to offer real-time monitoring and automatic distress alerts.Sudarshana is built to detect signs of panic or danger, triggering alerts with the user’s exact GPS location to pre-selected emergency contacts.The device aims to empower women by providing an immediate, discreet way to call for help, even when they are unable to do so manually. Our mission is to give women the power to feel safe anywhere, with an automated, real-time alert system that ensures help is always one step ahead, no matter what.</p>
